				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing
					less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used
					to lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then
					floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a
					lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it’s
					intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid
					actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve
					the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

					There are two primary things that inspired me to create this guide. The first is Rachel Andrew’s
					awesome book Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout. It’s a thorough, clear introduction to Grid and is the
					basis of this entire article. I highly encourage you to buy it and read it. My other big inspiration
					is Chris Coyier’s A Complete Guide to Flexbox, which has been my go-to resource for everything
					flexbox. It’s helped a ton of people, evident by the fact that it’s the top result when you Google
					“flexbox.” You’ll notice many similarities between his post and mine, because why not steal from the
					best?

					My intention with this guide is to present the Grid concepts as they exist in the very latest
					version of the specification. So I won’t be covering the out of date IE syntax, and I’ll do my best
					to update this guide regularly as the spec matures.</p>

				<h2>Basics and Browser Support</h2>
				<p>As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on
					Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other
					hand support it, but it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid
					is now!

					To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column
					and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements
					into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid
					items doesn’t matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange
					your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely
					rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is
					one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.</p>

				<h2>Important Terminology</h2>
				<p>Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms
					involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one another if you
					don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t
					many of them.</p>
